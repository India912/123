                Why Insurance?
            </p>
        </center>

        <p style="font-size:20px">
            Have you ever had a moment — while looking at your insurance policy or shopping for insurance — when you’ve thought, “What is insurance? And do I really need it?”

            You’re not alone.<br /><br />
            Insurance is tricky. It's not like buying a chair or a shirt or groceries. When you buy insurance, you're buying a promise. It's a promise that if something catastrophic happens to your business, your carrier is going to assist you to make your business whole again. Sometimes, though, it's tempting to question the value of insurance because it is an intangible product.

            <br /><br />
            Insurance is a financial safety net, helping you and your loved ones recover after something bad happens — such as a fire, theft, lawsuit or car accident. When you purchase insurance, you’ll receive an insurance policy, which is a legal contract between you and your insurance provider. And when you suffer a loss that’s covered by your policy and file a claim, insurance pays you or a designated recipient, called a beneficiary, based on the terms of your policy.
            <br /><br />
            The most difficult thing about insurance is that you’re paying for something you hope you never have to use. Nobody wants something bad to happen to them. But suffering a loss without insurance can put you in a difficult financial situation.
            <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:30px">Benefits of Insurance?</p><br />
        <p style="font-size:20px">
            Insurance is an important financial tool. It can help you live life with fewer worries knowing you’ll receive financial assistance after a disaster or accident, helping you recover faster. When it comes to life insurance, this could mean your family doesn’t have to move out of the house or that your kids can afford to go to college. For auto insurance, it could mean you have extra cash in hand to help pay for repairs or a replacement vehicle after an accident. Insurance can help keep your life on track, as much as possible, after something bad derails it.
            <br /><br />
            <h3>1.) Insurance Keeps Commerce Moving</h3>
            In the days after the 9/11 attacks, there were many worries about insurance coverage. Acts of war are not covered by insurance. Was terrorism an act of war? The big question was, How would the 9/11 attacks be classified? Fortunately, the insurance industry decided the attacks were not an act of war.

            However, after 9/11, some insurers began excluding terrorism. But the federal government stepped in and required coverage in the name of keeping commerce moving. In this case, insurance likely prevented many businesses from avoiding terrorist-targeted operations, such as refineries and chemical haulers.

            <h3>2.) Lenders Require Insurance</h3>
            This reason is tied to No. 1. Lenders require that you have insurance. Think about it: Mortgage lenders want proof of insurance before you buy or build a new building. In short, to get the money your business needs to keep going, it’s likely you enjoy the benefits of insurance. Without insurance, your winning business model can't get the funding it needs to take its first step, or your established business model can't get the funding to evolve and better compete.

            <h3>3.) Insurance is Compulsory in Some States</h3>
            Insurance is important because sometimes it's the law! A great example of this is auto insurance. Auto insurance is compulsory in Wisconsin (home of HNI HQ). Auto insurance helps mitigate the risk of life on the road (of which there are many!). Workers' compensation is a form of compulsory insurance that's required in most states.

            <h3>4.) Insurance Grants Peace of Mind</h3>
            Insurance, an intangible, provides another intangible: peace of mind. Business owners can take on certain business ventures because they can shift the risk — thanks to insurance. This reason is the counterpart to No. 2 — lenders require insurance. Insurance is the required (by lenders) safety net that lets entrepreneurs explore opportunity.

            <h3>5.) Insurance Ensures Family and Business Stability</h3>
            Insurance is a safety net for when risks go wrong. Life insurance can support the life of a family, should a member be lost. It’s similar for a business. Should a key member or piece of equipment go out of commission, the business can carry on, thanks to insurance. This reason why insurance is important dovetails nicely with peace of mind (No. 4). It all goes back to the idea that insurance, when activated, makes policyholders whole again.

            <h3>6.) Insurance Protects the Small Guys</h3>
            When you look at your industry, you see the "big guys" and the "small guys." If a risk goes wrong, the big guys will be able to survive. They can take a hit. But the little guys can't take a hit. As a result, they are more risk averse, and in some cases, they sell out to the big guys. If enough little guys leave the industry (and one big guy swallows them up), you're left with a monopoly. With insurance, however, the little guys have support if they want to take a risk, which means they stick around longer. What it comes down to is that insurance helps prevent monopolies from forming.

            <h3>7.) Insurance is the Right Thing to Do</h3>
            A sobering example of insurance in action is the West Fertilizer Co. explosion in Texas this spring. The explosion did $100 million in damage to the community, including schools and hospitals. The fertilizer company had only $1 million in general liability coverage.

            Now the city is suing West Fertilizer and likely will win all of the company’s remaining property and assets that were not damaged by the disaster. This is because the fertilizer company did not have enough insurance. What’s more is the city also is suing the suppliers to the fertilizer plant, claiming they knew they were supplying inherently dangerous materials. In the case of the West, Texas, plant explosion, insurance could have helped a community to recover after a crisis.

            Insurance is something many business owners don't want to think about. But whether they think about insurance, with hope it's there, allowing for transfer of risk and providing a safety net for new opportunities.

            <h2>  How does insurance work?</h2>
            Insurance is essentially a gigantic rainy day fund shared by many people (called policyholders) and managed by an insurance carrier. The insurance company uses money collected (called premium) from its policyholders and other investments to pay for its operations and to fulfill its promise to policyholders when they file a claim.

            Because of the unpredictable nature of natural disasters — like tornadoes, hail, wildfires and hurricanes, and everyday disasters such as fender benders and kitchen fires — an insurance company’s main goal is to remain financially strong enough to handle anything that comes its policyholders’ way.

                    If anyone depends on you financially, finding the best life insurance for your situation is essential. Life insurance is one way to replace your income if you die unexpectedly.

                    Life insurance policies usually fall into two main buckets: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.
                    Term life insurance lets you lock in rates for a particular length of time, like 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. During this time, your premiums are level. Once the level term period ends, you can typically renew the policy on a yearly basis but at a higher cost each time.

                    If you want to cover a specific financial obligation, like the years of college or a debt, term life insurance may be a good fit for you.

                    Medical bills are one of the frequent causes of financial hardship in America, according to the American Public Health Association. Even if you’re young and healthy, a stay in the hospital could cost you about $30,000 for three days, according to Healthcare.gov. If you’re uninsured, that could wreck your finances.

                    Health insurance or medical insurance is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. As with other types of insurance, risk is shared among many individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health risk and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax.

                    Whether it’s a vacation of a lifetime or a cross-country trip for a cousin’s wedding, you may be wondering when or if it’s worthwhile to buy travel insurance. Probably the best answer is that it depends on what you can afford to lose. By understanding what travel insurance is and what it covers, you’ll be able to make the best decision on whether to buy it.

                    Travel insurance is coverage designed to protect against risks and financial losses that could happen while traveling. The risks range from minor inconveniences such as missed airline connections and delayed luggage all the way to more serious issues including injuries or major illness.
